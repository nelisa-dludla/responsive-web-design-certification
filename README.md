# Responsive Web Design Certification

This repository contains my projects and exercises completed as part of the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification. The certification focuses on developing foundational skills in HTML5, CSS3, and responsive web design principles. Each project in this repository demonstrates my ability to create responsive and visually appealing web pages.

1. **Tribute Page**: A simple tribute page dedicated to a person of your choice.
2. **Survey Form**: A survey form to collect feedback or information from users.
